# GlaserCalc
The GlaserCalc plug-in is based on the Glaser method, a mathematical verification method in accordance with DIN 4108-3, to determining whether and where condensation occurs in a building structure. The material structure of individual IFC building elements is used for this and missing values can be added to the table.
